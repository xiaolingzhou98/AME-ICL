{"task": "scicite", "input": "Is the following citation from a scientific paper describing a method, a result, or background?\n\"For example, Kawato et al. (1990) suggested that movement trajectories can be projected using critical via-points through which the trajectory has to pass at a certain time, rather than in terms of the moment-by-moment dynamics of the implemented movement trajectory. Optimal trajectories can then be learnt by applying local optimising principles for getting from one via-point to the next. In this way, impoverished predictions can be used to monitor rich implementations. In the same way, language users might predict particularly crucial aspects of an utterance, but the aspects that they predict will depend on the circumstances. More generally, Meyer & Hagoort question the value of predicting one\u2019s own utterance. They argue that prediction is useful when it is likely to differ from the actual event. This is the case when predicting another person\u2019s behaviour or when the result of one\u2019s action is uncertain (e.g., moving in a strong wind). But they argue that people are confident about their own speech. Meyer & Hagoort admit that they will tend to be less confident in dialogue, and we agree. But more important, we argue that the behaviour of the production implementer is not fully determined by the production command, because the complex processes involved in production are subject to internal (\u201cneural\u201d) noise or priming (i.e., influences that may not be a result of the production command). Assuming that these sources of noise do not necessarily affect forward modelling as well, predicted speech may differ from actual speech. In addition, prediction is useful even if the behaviour is fully predictable, because it allows the actor to plan future behaviour on the basis of the prediction. In fact, we made such a proposal in relation to the order of heavy and light phrases (see sect. 3.1, target article).

In Section 4 we prove the asymptotic optimality of these adaptive tests in the multiparameter case, extending Lorden\u2019s (1983) result for the special case d = 1.

{"task": "scicite", "input": "Is the following citation from a scientific paper describing a method, a result, or background?\n\"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and K\u00fchholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart.\"\nAnswer:", "output": "result", "options": ["method", "background", "result"]}
